    <h3>For Experssion and Freedom</h3>
    
    <p>People over the decads and centry's have made great way into dance by expression
      and freedom. For example the tribes of the native world dance was a way to show great love for thier ancestors
      and family. This was passed down generatio to generation and still is strong in the indian culture today. Another example is
      expresstion and freedom in cuture dance. You can really tell how people behave or act by the type dance they do, for example, 
      african dance which which later transpired jazz dance in america. Becuase of this, I have a firm belief that it 
      has made way of thier freedom and integrety here in america. Naturally their are alot of examples of movments in dance
      that transform actural movements in the political world.
